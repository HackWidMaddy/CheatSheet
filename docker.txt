virtulization means dividing hardware among the os 


and in docker we divide os to handle other os

docker has continers in which we can instsall os

container crazy fast light weight computes

in container are isolated 




Docker comands
Download OS-
docker pull centos


to run the container
	switches	name	   name of os
docker run -d -t --name mycontainer centos

to show all the docker container
docker ps


to work with that os
docker exec -it mycontainer bash




enable us to work with different versions of an os
docker pull centos:frenchpress



docker run -t -d -p 80:80 --name ncoffee nameofconatiner:frenchpress



docker stop nameofcontainer

docker stats nameofconatiner
