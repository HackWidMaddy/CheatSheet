BASH - Bourne Again Shell discovered in 1989 its programming/scripting language

#! - Shibang

which is used to tell which programming language are we using python,bash,

Sleep in bash:
sleep 2


variables in bash

name = 'chuck'

to use variable
echo 'Hello $name'


To take input
read variable-name
read name


To get argument
name=$1
echo "hello $name"
run script as ./script name

More positional argumants use $2


To store output of a command and store in variable use
date = $(date)



RANDOM IN LINUX
echo $RANDOM
0-32767


all built in variables
$pwd
$RANDOM
$hostname
$USER



We can also create system variable by just typing this in shell
eg:
twitter='Elon Must'
echo $twitter

But this variables cannot be used in our bash script
to make variables usable in bash script we create environment variables


To make environment variable
export twitter
simple as that


But this variable is not permanenet to make it permanenet we use make changes in bashrc


To do math in bash

bash do not give answer in float
echo $(( 2 * 3))
first opening bracket is its a bash and second opening is that its a arithmetic equeatoin


Conditionals in bash

if[[ $variablename == "Yes" ]]; then
	echo "something"
else
	echo "something"
fi



if[[ $variablename == "Yes" || $variablename == "someothergame" ]]; then
	echo "something"
else
	echo "something"
fi








if[[ $variablename == "Yes" && $variablename == "someothergame" ]]; then
	echo "something"
else
	echo "something"
fi


Nested If  


if [[ $number == $demonchoice || $number == "coffee" ]]; then
        if [[ $USER == "root" ]]; then
                echo "Beast disappear"
        fi
else
        echo "You lose"
fi


Elif in bash



if [[ $number == $demonchoice || $number == "coffee" ]]; then
        echo "bEAST GAYAB"
elif [[ $USER == "greencat" ]]; then
        echo "Benard is always win"
else
        echo "yOU died"
fi



case in bash 

read number

case $number in
        1)
                echo "You are samosa 1"
                ;;
        2)
                echo "You are samosa 2"
                ;;
        3)
                echo "You are samosa 3"
                ;;
esac



loops in bash 

while loop
x = 1
while [[ $x -le 10 ]]
do
	(( x ++ ))
done


(( x ++ )) is used to increment  



while [[ $x -le 100 ]]
do
  echo "I just did $x pushup"
  (( x ++ ))
done


read a file


x=1

while read -r line; do
echo "Line $x $line"
(( x ++ ))
done < notes.txt

                echo "$domain is up"
        else
                echo "$domain is down"
        fi

until loop

until [[ $order == "coffee" ]]

        read order

for cups in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10;
do
        echo "You have $cups of coffe today"
done


cups will be assigned number form array one by one
